  _info:
  - Books are an extremely important part of my daily routine.
  - "I\u2019ve read a lot across the years. "
  - "The sole reading of theories and story though would often cause me to detach
    from reality. My writings would often be too philosophical, lost in my own words.
    I\u2019m well self-aware of this limitation, the years of talking to myself made
    me quite aware of my own thought process, empiricism and prejudice, while this
    statement itself is also a claim of ignorance. For there is no well-rounded mind,
    there is always edges you can\u2019t reach. The more I read, the more I realize
    my ignorance, I thought knowledge itself would fulfill me, but apparently not.
    Yet this might be such a bad thing, not being fulfilled, so there is always something
    to look forward too. "
