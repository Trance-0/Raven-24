Dead Roses



Fresh roses smells like the flavor of tea interweaved through fruity sweet berries   , whereas dead roses reminds me of the past---like rough, smoked, dry timber. While the fresh is restricted to the moment, the dead settles in eternity.   One valued for its beauty and symbol for love, the other for its long-lived memories.       **Bloody tears,**  why live dying when you could die living?
