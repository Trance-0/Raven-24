 











I have these weird memories that feel like it doesn’t belong me, of these these stranger's memories.



knowledge that’s not my property. This scenery, objects around me I don’t quite remember possessing. 

It is constantly changing, the room. I CAN FEEL IT!!! A hidden stranger staring at me. Moving things around. 

 

Yet all feel kind of familiar. Old friends. Existence that overlaps with mine.

 

It might just be my paranoia, anxiety from losing sleep. I need to rest a bit, though with cautious.
