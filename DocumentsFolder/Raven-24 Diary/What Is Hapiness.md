**What is happiness?**

 

A mirror of your misery? A form of self-anesthesia?

 

There is no ultimate happiness, there is no absolute state of satisfactory.

The concept of happiness requires dissatisfactory as its pre-condition,

heavily based on the margin between what you are and what you wish.

By establishing this gap between expectation and reality, one would experience a flash of euphoria by reaching his assumed end, then soon moved on to the next.

 

We desire things that we do not desire.

All happiness exists from your dissatisfaction.

As All happiness exists from beyond your reach;

All happiness exists not within but without ourselves;  

 

Iâ€™ve struggled a long time to sustain my positivity, my optimism, and constantly aiming towards happiness. But, as time went by, I realize it is simply impossible. I thought true happiness is the key for my salvation from suffering, but it is the exact concept that is enslaving me. Ironically the eternal suffering which I was avoiding, remained as the one forever consistence existence in life. Through these suffering I grew, learned and experienced life as it is.  By treating suffering as both mean and end in itself, happiness is derived from the the margin between suffering.
