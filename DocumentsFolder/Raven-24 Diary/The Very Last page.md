Dear 



No one has killed me.



The sad truth is, it was me who tied the knot, the one who raised my head with gentle determination.



I 'm sorry to put you in such shock seeing me under such state. you must be confused, speechless with words of refusal.

Yet, forgive me for taking advatage of these few moments of rejection, and speak to as if breathing.



 I once held a mind of pure rationale, nihilism and  isolationism as the true way of living, as my inly religion.   . 

I thought was all-knowin \. I thought I didn't need anyone.    



But apparently I s knew so trivial.  



The weeks I spend with you brought me the joy of a lifetime.   



I want to end it as such, in this moment, where the rain is purple, sun bright, and when I can still remember the your lovely smile.



I won't be able feel anything after I die, and I won't  be able to know what comes after, so to say I'm not scared is a lie. 



This is the only way

 

For  “Life can only be understood backwards, but **it must be lived forwards**” 



I love you. 



Thank you for taking me out my infinite torturing hell of trying to understand.



And letting me,finally for once, "lived forward".                



Forever.......
