It takes two people and an ordered chess board to start a game of chess.

 

For the board alone is a world, story and life set in static.

 

Me alone on this board is but my self-indulgence of destined victory of manipulating either side. 

 

Only with both player can the board showcase its full beauty and complexity， allowing us to experience the full transcendent of love an glory. 

 

That’s why I’m so glad I have chance to play with her.

 

To be honest, it’s not the game itself that’s interesting, I never really expected her to win in first place, and expected a game where its just solely my mind playing against myself.  



Yet, somehow she exceed that assumption.  HaHa what a pleasant surprise, I had no idea how she did it.  I thought I knew everything, such sudden loss brought back subtle old feelings I haven't felt in a while, those that deviates from those bland emotions.

 

It’s been a long time since I ever actually played with anyone, and it seems like she is really enjoying it. I like laughing with her, though it is also selfish for me to do so.
