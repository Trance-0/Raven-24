A philosopher and his shadow

 

I’m tired. Tired of following. Who am I, what am I, why should I follow? I have no touch, no pain, nothing but sorrow. Oh, but I seem to be able to think. A vague thought that is, nothing else to think about but to follow! Am I even real? I guess “I think therefore I am”. But those are just words, words that you read but I can’t seem to follow. Is there a problem? That I can’t seem to keep up. I ponder through light and darkness, lost and bewildered. Maybe I am nothing else but your shadow. 

No this shall not be! Come on! raise your hand and bless me a drink. While you’re drunk by thoughts and whine, I shall stay drunk between dusk and dawn. You feel these senses, but my thoughts are as real! You walk up to heaven, a place too bright. Fell through hell, where my existence fades. These journeys you seek for I do not desire. Eventually, it is you, my friend, the reason for my dire. Sorry, the time has come, for me to leave. I shall head towards darkness, settle upon “nothing”. Do you ask for a gift? but what Can I give? Maybe the same darkness or maybe some “vain”. But I wish this darkness shall not take your daylight, and this vainness not steal the space of your heart. Farewell, my friend, for I shall leave. Finally, a journey alone, a journey without you or other shadows come and leave. Only if I sink into darkness, shall the world belong to me.
