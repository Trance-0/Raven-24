I couldn’t really sleep last night after putting down my pen. I continued thinking. But at least I calmed down.  

  

I mean most likely it’s just a self-projection of my inner experience on to these objects. My state of paranoid. 

 

What seems is not what is. 

 

It’s but my empiricism perception that is fooling me from what’s true!!!! From reality.

 

I swear, there is something wrong.

 

The only logical thing is for me to keep track on these objects. I need to keep track what reality and object actually is. Around me. These would either be the record to a NEW Reality, or the final witness of my detreating mind, going insane.
