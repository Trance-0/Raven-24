It only takes one fractured mind and a non-existing board to play chess



Forules and games established by the board, are all achievable through bare imagination and intellect.



Me alone in my mind, drowning in its complex logic and traveling beyond the limitation of two.



Only within no-ground and fragmented space does the game best reflect reality.



That's why I always play staring at the wall.	



To be frank, there came a certain point where I realized mind too, has a limit.   As each game became progressively less excitin, often way to predicatable or dull.



Yet, this is the only thing that keeps me sane. That makes me feel like there is still SOMEBODY on the otherside of that board in the corner.



Itâ€™s been a long time since I ever actually played with anyone, and it seems like she is really enjoying it. I like laughing with her, though it is also selfish for me to do so.
