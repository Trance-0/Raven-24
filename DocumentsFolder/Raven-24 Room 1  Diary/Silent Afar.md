**Silence Afar**

 

I Gazed beyond the distant, endless.

Pointless，that infinite dragged-on railway, slowly rusting away.

I lay my head on the ice-cold steel, letting it slowly freeze my body, mind and soul.

Quiet, calming, as the chaos in my head grew.

The sound of nothing is one that’s most deadly.

 

I gently fell asleep, restless.

Exposed and vulnerable, a prey waiting to be devoured.     

Steadily amplifying in the background, a hint of Roughness, irregularly roaring.

Soon the sharp, no resonant sound of cold metal striking.

The clink and clanks of the mechanical parts.

Dragging of chains, smell of burning charcoal, piercing ring of bells.

Ripping me apart.

 

Sweet dreams, long-promised silence.
