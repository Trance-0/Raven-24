The project is a puzzle solving game with transformation in time.

In the game, the player need to help main character to address some puzzle and find solution to the life of the main character.

However, the main character is a patient with Alzheimer's disease, which is, the player.  

The scene is divided by the stage of the main character's life. According to the *Erikson's Eight Stages of Psychological Development*. (Reference: [The science of psychology](https://timsappsychology.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/by-laura-a.-king-professor-the-science-of-psycho-3367724-z-lib.org_.pdf))

* Trust vs. Mistrust

* Autonomy vs. Shame and doubt

* Initiative vs. Guilt

* Industry vs. Inferiority

* Identity vs. Identity Confusion

  **Developmental period**: Adolescence (10–20 years) **Characteristics**: Individuals are faced with finding out who they are, what they are all about, and where they are going in life. An important dimension is the exploration of alternative solutions to roles. Career exploration is important.

* Intimacy vs. Isolation

  **Developmental period**: Early adulthood (20s, 30s) **Characteristics**: Individuals face the developmental task of forming intimate relationships with others. Erikson described intimacy as finding oneself yet losing oneself in another person. 

* Generativity vs. Stagnation

  **Developmental period**: Middle adulthood (40s, 50s) **Characteristics**: A chief concern is to assist the younger generation in developing and leading useful lives.

* Integrity vs. Despair

  **Developmental period**: Late adulthood (60s– ) **Characteristics**: Individuals look back and evaluate what they have done with their lives. The retrospective glances can be either positive (integrity) or negative (despair).

时间的作用：

* 调整光线【lv.2】
* 通过和其他时间显示设备的联动调整**范围内的时间**，可以改变season，years【lv.4】
* 携带未来的东西解决过去的谜题，弥补缺憾，**得到的新道具不能对未来的剧情走向造成影响（相当于收藏品）**。【lv.5】

Reference









Violence and recklessness, profound social withdrawal, and self-mutilation are not, as we shall see, unique to our species. But perhaps suicide is.

Encompass’d with a thousand dangers, Weary, faint, trembling with a thousand terrors.… I … in a fleshly tomb, am Buried above ground. —WILLIAM COWPER



A tiny blade will sever the sutures of the neck, and when that joint, which binds together head and neck, is cut, the body’s mighty mass crumples in a heap. No deep retreat conceals the soul, you need no knife at all to root it out, no deeply driven wound to find the vital parts; death lies near at hand.… Whether the throat is strangled by a knot, or water stops the breathing, or the hard ground crushes in the skull of one falling headlong to its surface, or flame inhaled cuts off the course of respiration—be it what it may; the end is swift. —SENECA



To whom it may concern, If I should die in my childhood, this is my will. I have no money, except $2.95 in the bank, and a little in defense stamps. This is to be given to Robert C——, my nephew. My clothing goes to charity or to anyone that wants them. If I am laid out I would like to be dressed in blue. If I have a funeral all friends and relatives are invited to attend. To my mother I give all I have and everything I possess. To my father and sister all my love and all I possess. No one has killed me. I wish to die. I have committed suicide

无限列车 



In my beginning is my end. In succession Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended, Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass. Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires, Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth Which is already flesh, fur and faeces, Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf. ----TS eliot
