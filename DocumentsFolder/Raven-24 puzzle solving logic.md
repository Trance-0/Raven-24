I love chess

 

“A chessboard that usually associate with a man’s wisdom.

 

A game that usually rely on the decisions of sacrifice.

 

A match and a war, put you on the edge of exploration and exploitation.”

 

The beginning of chess, prevailed among aristocrats and nobles. Soon became a writer’s game, a delicate metaphor, one that is often romanticized. Take "Scachs d'Amor", The Chess Game of Love, played between Venus and Mars. 

​                                                         

Don Francí de Castellví, act the role of Mars. In the name of love; His standard Red (white); King with reason; Queen, will; Knight, praises; Rook, flaring desires; Pawn provides loyal services. 

 

Narcís Vinyoles，takes the form of Venus. In the name of glory; Her standard green (black). King with honor; Queen, beauty; Knights, disdain; Rook, cautious reserve; Pawn took graceful courtesy.

 

Mossèn Fenollar，mercury. Maker, speaker and order of the game. Separate the board into ivory white and endless black. Here, TIME is divided, split into day and night. Put into the author’s phrase:

 

“Mercury, always ready in his ways, Painted the board with hues clear and dark: And made it Time, split into days and nights, A box to bring the first enclosures. Crossing it, he divided it into four natures of times diverse; and then, in following his guides, of each part he made four equal parts. By dividing in this mode, the rest, the list adds up to four and sixty”

 

Oh, glorious lovers, destined, clearly arranged by time. 

 

Such love is not pure impulse or momentary passion. Such Glory is not self-serving narcissism or blinding of eye. For only under mercury’s law of time and space are things in certain movement, yet all so unpredictable.  Here, both love and glory are put to the test: Through night and day, seemingly meaningless and designed movement, one would realize: the meaningless cycle of these movements is what urges us to find our own meaning. 

 

Our own creative and intelligence way to play these self-determined pieces.

 

Through such a “game”. The momentary feelings of in this case love and glory go through metamorphosis, transcending into responsibility and humbleness.

 

That is my philosophy of chess, the reason for my obsession, lost in its intellectually design ordered chaos, within time and space.........
