# Address Prior Problem

The **main** problem of conflict, directed towards the little girl instead of the mom.



The **secondary** problem of  constructed intimacy

我不想要纯粹的创伤，要在表面最美好的image下藏刀，这样永远显得是美好的。

小女孩在战争的压力下自杀，     遗物 “表”

白天很正常的玩耍，藏着玩，母亲慈爱，然而却并非如此，尝试遮掩自己的记忆，





Violence and recklessness, profound social withdrawal, and self-mutilation are not, as we shall see, unique to our species. But perhaps suicide is.

Encompass’d with a thousand dangers, Weary, faint, trembling with a thousand terrors.… I … in a fleshly tomb, am Buried above ground. —WILLIAM COWPER



A tiny blade will sever the sutures of the neck, and when that joint, which binds together head and neck, is cut, the body’s mighty mass crumples in a heap. No deep retreat conceals the soul, you need no knife at all to root it out, no deeply driven wound to find the vital parts; death lies near at hand.… Whether the throat is strangled by a knot, or water stops the breathing, or the hard ground crushes in the skull of one falling headlong to its surface, or flame inhaled cuts off the course of respiration—be it what it may; the end is swift. —SENECA



To whom it may concern, If I should die in my childhood, this is my will. I have no money, except $2.95 in the bank, and a little in defense stamps. This is to be given to Robert C——, my nephew. My clothing goes to charity or to anyone that wants them. If I am laid out I would like to be dressed in blue. If I have a funeral all friends and relatives are invited to attend. To my mother I give all I have and everything I possess. To my father and sister all my love and all I possess. No one has killed me. I wish to die. I have committed suicide





Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past. If all time is eternally present All time is unredeemable.    -------TS Eliot



无限列车 



In my beginning is my end. In succession Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended, Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass. Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires, Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth Which is already flesh, fur and faeces, Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf. ----TS eliot









 Houses live and die: there is a time for building And a time for living and for generation And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.
