 **Chess and War (Intelligence and morality)**

[Scene 1] THE ROOM

 

The room is quite small, barely enough space to fit that of an adult, one could only Imagine a child living here.  

 

It’s raining for forever, lost track of when it begins, time seems like a deep abyss with pitch black end, or maybe... infinite.... 

 

Silent clear tone of the piano floats in the background, the solemn posture of an invisible pianist, running his fingers lightly over the black and white keys, where the notes smoothly connect. 

 

A true artist setting the mood and color for this grayish scenery.  

 

Besides the sole lonely music, the only source of entertainment would be the scatter chess set laying on the ground. Its darker black stand out against the light grey back ground. There, in the middle of the room, it seems to be the center of attention. Just sitting, quietly, waiting for someone to slowly and eventually be drag towards it…

 

**[Scene 2] THE CHESSBOARD**

 

*Prologue:*

 

“A chessboard that usually associate with a man’s wisdom.

A game that usually rely on the decisions of sacrifice.

A match and a war, the exploration, memory or rediscovery of a man’s intelligence and morality.”

 

The story begins after his father died… after the turn of event……. after the calming white splash of ocean became out of reach.

 

This is the chapter where his dream turns to reality, Where the waves gone wild.

 

*Main Dream 1*

 

He was a child around the age between 16-24. His mother was never the same as before, locked him in this narrow room, afraid to lose him like how she lost his father.

 

He was lonely, without a purpose. He was kept away, different from other kids his age. 

 

He has no purpose.

 

All he had was his chessboard, one could imagine he was fairly good at it.(a intellgence)

 

What else, he might think, what drag him out of bed every morning bright.

 

That beautiful sound piano, haunting yet charming, is what brings him out of THE ROOM.

 

He wondered what she looked like, old, young, similar too his age? He would kill himself to known

 

*Main HOPE 2* 

(“She” is an assumption, it is deferred from her step, hence actually the gender is only what the character assumes)

The girl, yes, it is a “she”, or is it not quite the way to refer her. I don’t quite know since it’s been, God knows how long I’ve seen anyone.

 

They moved here about a week ago. 

 

She likes sneaking here, to play chess.  I hear her gentle footstep, wouldn’t quite say “hear”, more off “silent” sound. 我听见她轻轻的脚步声，也许“听见”并不是很恰当，不如说是无声的声音。  Mom never noticed.



Main Main THE GAME 3

 

Now the game:  

 \1. Start as a normal game of chess with normal conversation between the two.(dialogue)

​        Boy:

​        Girl: you always win (intelligence or whateve)

​        Boy:

​        Girl:

​        Boy: 

 

\2. shift in perspective as a hand reach from behind (became small)

 

\3.   Small drama development:

 

   Stage 1: lock: become a chess piece with lock on his foot or whatever, as long as he can’t move. (My personal interpretation was that he was indeed being locked, I guess, its better to have a more obvious symbolism) [Character emotions: I guess he could be Kind of confused, its reasonable to imagine it that way, the perplexity sort of correspond with his lack of purpose being strangled by his mother (out of a twisted love or protective reason?), just what I’m thinking lol]

​     

​      Move: Yeah, the character is free to move! Great! The symbolism of freedom and the coming consequence. 

​       I mean just think of no game no life, there is one similar theme but imagine yourself as one of the chess pieces.  YOU ARE MEANT TO KILL EACH OTHER!

​       Cool, if intelligence was the previous theme, then here, we are going for moral!!!! So in the process you can chose to save a chess(soilder) or let him go, you known the typical war scenario, but whatever you choose HE IS GOING TO DIE, the chess piece I mean, you known the main character got to have some regret.   

​        He gets pick up, flash of navy war, then checkmate.

 

*Main DESPAIR or HOPE? 4*

(Two version)

\1.   As the giant chess fell, the heavy door knocked, the girl disappears, which you know the Mom sort of begging no and then BAMMM  ------The end

 

My two personal understanding of the scene, first the girl left, that’s it, the knock was from the conscription, he will join the navy, oveRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

 

Second the girl disappears because its his illusion, the piano is but the mixture of the silent tapping on the black and white chess board and his never possibly accomplished hope for beauty and freedom, then the conscription.  MIND BREAK MEMORIES! Or might also be his real memories who knows?
