自杀线



1939 March 21



I lost 









Spring's gone winter's here



the return of a once brighter time.



The pressure of a single mom, 





empty

riding with death

Die once

Violence

self- destruction 

oblivion

I thought of millions ways how I would end



Deep Waters



who cares









Maybe the most delicate existence, is non existence
