Entity: two girls

Object: The general 



What I've intrinsically add has no form of influence on the major plot line or its basic logic. But it is an micro-emphasize or demonstration that if you pick up any given moment in the game, itself could function as both beginning and the end,  consistence with the key philosophy or logic.    For every line might be an deviation from the initial beginning point to reach the end hence itself, or every line is are points of the same nature, where you essentially never for a moment escape from where you started or finished.    

True, it is not exactly the same point, that's what makes every moment, your present, feel different from that of the other.

The beginning is the end theory on itself is a self standing logic that is self-supportive. Yet in this case, would also indicate that the mean to establish a cycle of beginning and end in itself is to much focused as the end, as we would conceptualize it as the end of the game in general. Which creates a weird self-contradicting mis interpretation of the scenario where other intrinsic logic   is beginning to be overshadowed.  I have established a plot line which heavily points at an exact time and space where the end and beginning is. Which is not the optimal way to approach this. To solve this, every single point of the cycle should be the beginning and the end.    Existing in itself, the point could also becomes a cycle, as a full-existence in itself, or the competent of establishing one.

 Catalan *Scachs d’amour* 



Chess soon became the writer’s game. The literate classes from England to Italy indulged in chess literature and criticism, with many writers seeing in chess a handy metaphor. Some turned to the game for romantic purposes: one of the earliest poems to mention chess, the Catalan *Scachs d’amour* (“Chess of Love”), recounts, move by move, a game played between Mars and Venus, whose respective warlike and amorous qualities are examined through the chessboard. Another popular poem of the time — *Les Échecs Amoureux*, written by an anonymous enthusiast — explores similar themes and generated a good deal of critical discourse. Even in *[The Tempest](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743482832/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=boorio-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0743482832)* we find Miranda and Ferdinand’s burgeoning romance quietly consummated in a chess match.
