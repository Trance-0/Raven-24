# Raven-24

## Name of game

Time, It's time. Raven-24. armillary, Kalina

## Abstract

A girl living in a small town using property of time to save her friend, but find her trapped in an endless cycle.

#### Philosophy of game:

***Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future (past and present may present in future, future>present, future>=past)), And time future contained in time past (past brings the possiblity of future, past>=future). If all time is eternally present All time is unredeemable.(thus, future=past=present)*** [preface]

Basically, it means that time is an endless loop, when it comes to end, the new story starts.

***Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards*** [ending]

Life is just series of event, they can only be understood when you retireve them from your memories. 

Sub topics:

*Everything is determined. You will never escape from the cycle of loss, suffer, and pain. (No resolution)*

*To search for meaning in a meaningless life, which is, finding the meaning of your life. Once you find it, you will lost all the purpose for living. (Not conclusive)*

#### Main Character

* The player ({player})
* His friend (Armil Kalina) (dead)
* The developer (if you wish)

#### Main Progression Indicator

* Checkpoint (Value of time) (use stories to unlock checkpoints of object, which could be used  to modify the past of object)
  * Related Objects (things to change when you unlock the story)
  * Point to recollect
* Diary (source of stories, when the past is modified, new stories would appear)
  * Once you get new object, new story (or story fragment) would unlock.
  * Recollection rate, integrity of the diary, determine the range of time you can retireve.

## UI Design

### Philosophy of Design

To bring player immersive experience, the only two object you will have is 

### The Mechanism

The only tool to solve puzzle, when you handle the mechanism and interact with object with properties in time, the **checkpoint** would light up on the solar ring. By rotating the ring, the player would change the time in the object to send the object or change the object to the past. (or future, possibly)

### The Diary of Kalina

Seem to be the only puzzle you need to solve.

When you click **memory fragments** with diary,  you will unlock new vague memory in diary (highlighed for first access), 

Every page of diary contains two parts:

#### Sample front page:

Only writing from Kalina.

| Empty memory          | Vague memory                                                 | Full memory                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <br /><br />   <br /> | Fresh Roses       <br />Fresh roses sadsfd, dry timber [] hile the[], the dead settles in eternity.   One []         **Violet Rain,** for dying is only apart of liv[]ne: Every sweet and sorr[] of past and future,** exist **here.** <br /> | Fresh Roses       <br />Fresh roses smells like the flavor of tea interweaved through fruity sweet berries   , whereas dead roses reminds me of the past---like rough, smoked, dry timber. While the fresh is restricted to the moment, the dead settles in eternity.   One valued for its beauty and symbol for love, the other for its long-lived **memories.**           <br />**Violet Rain,** for dying is only apart of living, dying apart of living.  There never was a choice,  as they are all apart of one: Every sweet and sorrow, every **fragment of past and future,** exist **here.** <br /> |

#### Sample back page: 

usually source of memory, may include dialogue or {player}'s inner thoughts.

#### Inner World:

Another separated world for plot. When grabbing object from outside world to inner world, the player can solve the puzzle in inner world. 

##### Phase 1

The player take objects from outside world and adding details to inner world.

##### Phase 2

The inner world is rich enough (in detail) comparing to outside world, the player can change inner world configuration by series of operations in outside world.

##### Phase 3

The outside world is almost empty and most operations are executed in inner world.

##### Phase 4

The player will live in inner world and can not exit the picure. 

## Object system

#### Memory fragments

The source (activator) of stories in diary. Once they are clicked, they will move to next position for target puzzle.

### Access point

The objects which have **checkpoints**, they can be used to develop the plot.

### Time Listener

Usually natural surroundings and animation objects, listenging to speed of time given my the mechanism. With range in one hour, the player can modify the speed of time in global space to solve puzzle about pitch of music, reverse play of song, slow opened drawer etc. Once the limit reached, the shadow of time would warn the player and the mechanism would lock automatically.

## Main Plot

## Possible Explanation

### Theory I

Player is trapped in her memory.

All the story is fake, time travel is just memory restoration. The player, with psychological disorder, is living forward and try to understand her life backward by retriving one of her memory.

##### Source of Power: Illusion

##### Reason for suiside: Merge of personality

### Theory II 

Time traveler.

Kalina is a time traveler come form future. She have lived in the room for thousands of years. The existence of the player disturbed the spacetime around the room and Kalina have to sacrifice herself to save the town from separated time.

##### Source of Power: natual born with

##### Reason for suiside: To stablize the spacetime

### Theory III

Nihilism

Kalina find her find no solution to nihlism and choose to end his meaningless life

##### Source of Power: given by developer

##### Reason for suiside: read too much books from schopenhauer
