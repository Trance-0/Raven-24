  - "I\u2019m tired. Tired of following. Who am I, what am I, why should I follow?
    I have no touch, no pain, nothing but sorrow. Oh, but I seem to be able to think.
    A vague thought that is, nothing else to think about but to follow! Am I even
    real? I guess \u201CI think therefore I am\u201D. But those are just words, words
    that you read but I can\u2019t seem to follow. Is there a problem? That I can\u2019t
    seem to keep up. I ponder through light and darkness, lost and bewildered. Maybe
    I am nothing else but your shadow. "
  - "No this shall not be! Come on! raise your hand and bless me a drink. While you\u2019re
    drunk by thoughts and whine, I shall stay drunk between dusk and dawn. You feel
    these senses, but my thoughts are as real! You walk up to heaven, a place too
    bright. Fell through hell, where my existence fades. These journeys you seek
    for I do not desire. Eventually, it is you, my friend, the reason for my dire.
    Sorry, the time has come, for me to leave. I shall head towards darkness, settle
    upon \u201Cnothing\u201D. Do you ask for a gift? but what Can I give? Maybe the
    same darkness or maybe some \u201Cvain\u201D. But I wish this darkness shall
    not take your daylight, and this vainness not steal the space of your heart.
    Farewell, my friend, for I shall leave. Finally, a journey alone, a journey without
    you or other shadows come and leave. Only if I sink into darkness, shall the
    world belong to me."
